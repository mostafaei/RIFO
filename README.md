# RIFO: Pushing the Efficiency of Programmable Packet Schedulers

This repository contains the code used in RIFO, which is currently under submission.

## What can I find in this repo?

* `java-code` contains the Java-based implementation of RIFO,  which is built on top of [NetBench](https://github.com/ndal-eth/netbench) and [AIFO](https://github.com/netx-repo/AIFO).
We have used this implementation to evaluate the performance of RIFO under different workload distributions in Section V.B. of the paper and compared its performance with the state-of-the-art programmable packet schedulers. 

* `p4-code` contains the P4_16 code RIFO on  Tofino programmable switches.

* `RIFO-plots` contains the plot scripts and their data for the figures if you do not want to run the simulations runs.
